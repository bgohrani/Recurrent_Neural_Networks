# Recurrent Neural Networks

## Hey There!

This repo consists of some of the code I've created while learning and implementing, Recurrent Neural Networks. These are a class of dynamic artificial neural networks where nodes
are connected to one another along a temporal sequence. This characteristic makes them very effective when it comes to dealing with variable length sequences tbc
